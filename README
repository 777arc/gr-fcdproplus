gr-fcdproplus is an linux addon for gnuradio to implement a funcube dongle pro+ source.
It autodetects the correct soundcard from /proc/asound/cards.
This idea was taken from the osmosdr drivers.

To control the device the hidraw code of the hidapi is used.


1. Dependencies:

- gnuradio
- alsa usb drivers activated

2. Installation

get the latest code from https://github.com/dl1ksv/gr-fcdproplus

The build process is cmake based. So change to code directory.
There
$mkdir build
$cd build
$cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<where gnuradio is installed> ../
$make
$su
$make install

After that you'll find in grc in Sources
Funcube Dongle Pro+ source
